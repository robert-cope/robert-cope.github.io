I am now a Lecturer in Statistics at the University of New England in Armidale, NSW, Australia.

Previously I was Lecturer in the Biological Data Science Institute at the Australian National University. I completed my PhD on the population genetics of dugongs at the University of Queensland in 2014.

I'm interested in applied stochastic modelling and Bayesian statistics in the biological sciences.
